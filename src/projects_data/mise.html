    <p>
        It's the year 2025, I love cooking, and I am tired of my scattered collection of bookmarked
        recipes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <a
            class="link"
            href="https://mise.jacopocalvi.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"

            Mise En Place
        </a> is a website I built using <b>Laravel</b> & <b>Vue</b> to solve this issue. With it,
        you can create or import recipes from your favourite sites (<b>with attribution of
        course!</b>). All of the recipes you care about in one place, in one format, editable as
        you please.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It is still in active development, and likely will always be.
        Oh, it is also public and <b>free</b>, give it a shot!
    </p>
