    <p>
        A fun and short retro shooter, with unpredictable controls.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Initially developed in <b>Unity</b> (<b>C#</b>) for <b>HackSussex’s GameJam (2023)</b>, where
        it won in two categories: <em>“most unconventional controls”</em> & <em>“best overall”</em>.
        <br/> I
        then re-wrote the entire project using <b>Godot</b>, because it's fun to learn.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You can (<b>and should</b>) play it
